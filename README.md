## Credits

The teacher and a TA noticed that I had two ports in use which were causing an error. I deleted it based on their advice. This code was deleted in server.js. The teacher noticed that my Product foreign key and Tag foreign key were wrong. I respectively changed the foreign keys to product_id and and tag_id. This code can be found in the folder models in the file index.js.
